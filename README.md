# SURF 101 
Surfing is an inspirational sport that immediately infects someone with the desire to take it up after seeing it for the first time.  And for those who know nothing about the sport, the biggest blocker to taking up the sport is, where do I start?  Surf 101 aims to address this question by being a starter kit for someone looking to take up the sport by providing all of the basic information in order to assist someone to get into the water and catch their first wave.
