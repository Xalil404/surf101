                <h6>Surfing as with any sport has a certain minimum amount of equipment needed in order to get started.  On this page we will only cover the bare minimum in order to get you started and have you catching your first wave.</h6>

                <p>#1 - board selection. Depending on how you plan to ride the waves, there are 3 styles to choose from.  If you want to get barreled and ride inside of the waves, you need a shortboard, around 6ft in height. If your intent is to ride a wave with no stress for a long period of time, get a long board, around 10ft in height.  If you want to experience the best of both worlds, get yourself a Fish surfboard.</p>

                <p>#2 - Don't forget the WAX! Regardless of what type of surfboard you select, at the end of the day they are all made of the same material - plastic or fiberglass to be technical.  This means that a surfboard's surface is extremely slippary and unless you wax it up and wax it up very well, standing on the surfboard is going to be impossible as you'll slip and fall every time.  It is recommended that you put a layer of wax on your board every single time that you plan on hitting the water.</p>

                <p>#3 - Grab a leash! This is probably the most important piece of equipment as your life could depend on it (Hopefully that never happens but better be safe than sorry). The leash is essential to keeping you safe in the water.  Every time you complete riding a wave, as you bail off of the wave, the leash will be your saviour to make sure your board does not get washed ashore and you can pull on it so that you have something to float on, be well rested in order to avoid any potential drowning.</p>

                <p>#4 - Suited & Booted! Depending on where you are geographically located, this one might be optional. If you live in Figi, Tahiti or the Maldives, feel free to skip this section however for the rest of having a wetsuit and booties is a must.  Considering the best waves happen during the winter season, if you want to last in the water longer than 15 seconds, then getting a wetsuit and booties for your feet are highly recommended.</p>
