                <h6>Now that you have your basic equipment and are ready to hit the beach, follow the steps below in order to catch your first wave. Prior to arriving to the beach, make sure you have checked the weather and forecasts to be sure there are waves available and the weather conditions are suitable and not dangerous to be swimming in the ocean.</h6>

            <div id="equip-1">
                <p>#1 - Check the forecast! The very first thing you should do before packing your equipment and heading to the beach is to check the weather and surf forecast either on TV or the internet. There is nothing more disappointing than arriving at the beach only to find the ocean or sea as flat as a lake.</p>
                <img src="assets/images/brian-mcgowan-kKyxIwvljBg-unsplash.webp" alt="image of a weather forecast">
                <p>#2 - Pack your stuff! Once you have confirmed that there are indeed waves via the surf forecast it's time to pack your surfing equipment and head to the beach. Remember that the bare minimum is a board, wax, surf leash and a wetsuit.</p>
                <img src="assets/images/sacha-verheij-X0rRYtJy0R8-unsplash.webp" alt="image of two surfers on a beach">
                <p>#3 - It's time to be a duck! As you are paddling towards the waves, on approach don't paddle into the wave directly as it will push you right back to the beach. On the wave approaching you, push your board into the water and together with your board attempt to dive under the wave - this technique is called "Duck Diving."</p>

                <p>#4 - The Lineup! As you are duck diving wave after wave, your goal is to reach the line-up. The line-up is the area of the beach or ocean where the waves start to break or fall. This is the place where you sit, rest and wait for your opportunity to catch your next wave.</p>
                <img src="assets/images/mathyas-kurmann-jnHQsTfq2Og-unsplash.webp" alt="image of a line up of ocean waves">
                <p>#5 - It's Go Time! Once you have identified a wave that you would like to catch, turn your board around and start paddling with the wave into the direction of the beach. Once you start feeling the wave pulling you, i.e. that the wave is pushing you forward without you having to paddle anymore, this is the moment where you finally push up to stand up and start riding along with the wave.</p>

                <p>#6 - The Finale! Once you have completed riding the wave it's time to jump off. As you jump off, it's important to jump away from your board in order not to collide with it in the water and hurting yourself. Don't panic, your board will not go anywhere, that is what the leash is for. As you re-surface, pull on your leash to retrieve your board, get on it, and start duck diving back up to the line-up to catch your next wave.</p>
